@misc{Goral1984,
abstract = {A method is described which models the interaction of light between diffusely reflecting surfaces. Current light reflection models used in computer graphics do not account for the object-to-object reflection between diffuse surfaces, and thus incorrectly compute the global illumination effects. The new procedure, based on methods used in thermal engineering, includes the effects of diffuse light sources of finite area, as well as the color-bleeding effects which are caused by the diffuse reflections. A simple environment is used to illustrate these simulated effects and is presented with photographs of a physical model. The procedure is applicable to environments composed of ideal diffuse reflectors and can account for direct illumination from a variety of light sources. The resultant surface intensities are independent of observer position, and thus environments can be preprocessed for dynamic sequences.},

We show how this model can be correctly integrated in importance sampling schemes for physically based Monte Carlo rendering algorithms The fourth section is devoted to alternative parameter spaces in which reflectance models can be sampled, either deteministically or stochastically. The last section discusses an important implementation issue, more specifically the problem of verifying the implementation of a reflectance model.},

abstract = {There is a need to develop shaders that not only "look good", but are more physically plausible. From physical and geometric considerations, we review the derivation of a shading equation expressing reflected radiance in terms of incident radiance and the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). We then examine the connection between this equation and conventional shaders used in computer graphics. Imposing the additional physical constraints of energy conservation and Helmholtz reciprocity allows us to create variations of the conventional shaders that are more physically plausible.},
