abstract = {Some applications of computer graphics require a vivid illusion of reality. These include the spatial organization of machine parts, conceptual architectural design, simulation of mechanisms, and industrial design. There has been moderate success in the automatic generation of wire frame, cardboard model, polyhedra, and quadric surface line drawings. The capability of the machine to generate vivid sterographic pictures has been demonstrated. There are, however considerable reasons for developing techniques by which line drawings of solids can be shaded, especially the enhancement of the sense of solidity and depth. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the value of shading and shadow casting in spatial description. In the line drawing there is no clue as to the relative position of the flat plane and the sheet metal console. When shadows are rendered, it is clear that the plane is below and to the rear of the console, and the hollow nature of the sheet metal assembly is emphasized. Shading can specify the tone or color of a surface and the amount of light falling upon that surface from one or more light sources. Shadows when sharply defined tend to suggest another viewpoint and improves surface definition. When controlled, shading can also emphasize particular parts of the drawing. If techniques for the automatic determination of chiaroscuro with good resolution should prove to be competitive with line drawings, and this is a possibility, machine generated photographs might replace line drawings as the principal mode of graphical communication in engineering and architecture.},

abstract = {A method is described which models the interaction of light between diffusely reflecting surfaces. Current light reflection models used in computer graphics do not account for the object-to-object reflection between diffuse surfaces, and thus incorrectly compute the global illumination effects. The new procedure, based on methods used in thermal engineering, includes the effects of diffuse light sources of finite area, as well as the color-bleeding effects which are caused by the diffuse reflections. A simple environment is used to illustrate these simulated effects and is presented with photographs of a physical model. The procedure is applicable to environments composed of ideal diffuse reflectors and can account for direct illumination from a variety of light sources. The resultant surface intensities are independent of observer position, and thus environments can be preprocessed for dynamic sequences.},

abstract = {This paper presents a two pass global illumination method based on the concept of photon maps. It represents a significant improvement of a previously described approach both with respect to speed, accuracy and versatility. In the first pass two photon maps are created by emitting packets of energy (photons) from the light sources and storing these as they hit surfaces within the scene. We use one high resolution caustics photon map to render caustics that are visualized directly and one low resolution photon map that is used during the rendering step. The scene is rendered using a distribution ray tracing algorithm optimized by using the in- formation in the photon maps. Shadow photons are used to render shadows more efficiently and the directional information in the photon map is used to generate optimized sampling directions and to limit the recursion in the distribution ray tracer by providing an estimate of the radiance on all surfaces with the exception of specular and highly glossy surfaces. The results presented demonstrate global illumination in scenes containing pro- cedural objects and surfaces with diffuse and glossy reflection models. The imple- mentation is also compared with the Radiance program.},

From physical and geometric considerations, we review the derivation of a shading equation expressing reflected radiance in terms of incident radiance and the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF).

Imposing the additional physical constraints of energy conservation and Helmholtz reciprocity allows us to create variations of the conventional shaders that are more physically plausible.},

abstract = {To accurately render a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene, global illumination information that affects the intensity of each pixel of the image must be known at the time the intensity is calculated. In a simplified form, this information is stored in a tree of "rays" extending from the viewer to the first surface encountered and from there to other surfaces and to the light sources. A visible surface algorithm creates this tree for each pixel of the display and passes it to the shader. The shader then traverses the tree to determine the intensity of the light received by the viewer. Consideration of all of these factors allows the shader to accurately simulate true reflection, shadows, and refraction, as well as the effects simulated by conventional shaders. Anti-aliasing is included as an integral part of the visibility calculations. Surfaces displayed include curved as well as polygonal surfaces.},
